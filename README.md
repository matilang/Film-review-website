# Task Manager API

A simple task management REST API built with FastAPI.

I regularly push new changes in this repository to build and improve my backend development and database management skills.  
The project's focus is on practical applications using FastAPI, relational databases, and best practices in API design.

## Features

- Create, update, and delete tasks
- Use of tokens and hashed passwords as security
- Implement SQLite-based database -> in future PostgreSQL
- Remembering about sorting, pagination, and filtering features

## Future plans

1. Developing tests for the backend
2. Learn and project more developed database (PostgreSQL) while developing new features of setting up accounts
3. Build a simple front for the website in React.js
4. Deploy project to the web
